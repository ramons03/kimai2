# Contributing

This is an open source project we welcome any support that you want to give. Just fork the repo and raise a PR.

## Pull request rules

We use the [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) package to generate the changelog. This uses commit lint rules. To enforce these rules for you run the following:

 * Install nvm[...](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=nodejs+install+nvm&t=canonical&ia=web)
 * `nvm use`
 * `npm install`

This should install the git hooks to check your commits are in the correct format.
